ABSTRACT = {During most of the lifespan of the Venetian republic, doges (the name their presidents received) were elected for life. However, a long tenure was a rare event, which effectively resulted in term limits, as has already been reported by several authors. In this paper, we examine the length of these tenures and their evolution during the existence of the Venetian republic, following Smith et al.&rsquo;s claim that specific events in Venetian history caused this shortening, but also the dates and possibly event or events that effectively caused that limitation by design. Finally, we will discuss the causes of this limitation and its effective consequences.},

abstract = {Abstract Basic traditional parametric statistical techniques are used widely in climatic studies for characterizing the level (central tendency) and variability of variables, assessing linear relationships (including trends), detection of climate change, quality control and assessment, identification of extreme events, etc. These techniques may involve estimation of parameters such as the mean (a measure of location), variance (a measure of scale) and correlation/regression coefficients (measures of linear association); in addition, it is often desirable to estimate the statistical significance of the difference between estimates of the mean from two different samples as well as the significance of estimated measures of association. The validity of these estimates is based on underlying assumptions that sometimes are not met by real climate data. Two of these assumptions are addressed here: normality and homogeneity (and as a special case statistical stationarity); in particular, contamination from a relatively few ‘outlying values’ may greatly distort the estimates. Sometimes these common techniques are used in order to identify outliers; ironically they may fail because of the presence of the outliers! Alternative techniques drawn from the fields of resistant, robust and non-parametric statistics are usually much less affected by the presence of ‘outliers’ and other forms of non-normality. Some of the theoretical basis for the alternative techniques is presented as motivation for their use and to provide quantitative measures for their performance as compared with the traditional techniques that they may replace. Although this work is by no means exhaustive, typically a couple of suitable alternatives are presented for each of the common statistical quantities/tests mentioned above. All of the technical details needed to apply these techniques are presented in an extensive appendix. With regard to the issue of homogeneity of the climate record, a powerful non-parametric technique is introduced for the objective identification of ‘change-points’ (discontinuities) in the mean. These may arise either naturally (abrupt climate change) or as the result of errors or changes in instruments, recording practices, data transmission, processing, etc. The change-point test is able to identify multiple discontinuities and requires no ‘metadata’ or comparison with neighbouring stations; these are important considerations because instrumental changes are not always documented and, particularly with regard to radiosonde observations, suitable neighbouring stations for ‘buddy checks’ may not exist. However, when such auxiliary information is available it may be used as independent confirmation of the artificial nature of the discontinuities. The application and practical advantages of these alternative techniques are demonstrated using primarily actual radiosonde station data and in a few cases using some simulated (artificial) data as well. The ease with which suitable examples were obtained from the radiosonde archive begs for serious consideration of these techniques in the analysis of climate data.},

    abstract = "{International trade can have profound effects on domestic institutions. We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800–1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families’ use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400–1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.}",

abstract="Between the fifth and the thirteenth century ad, from the fall of Rome to the stirrings of the Renaissance, the politics of Europe was monarchical and hierarchical, feudal, brutal and unfair. Throughout this exact period, Venice played a role in keeping democratic tendencies alive. Venice flourished in the so-called `Dark Ages', economically and intellectually, with a system of government that often fell into oligarchy and sometimes toyed with autocracy, but which nevertheless kept the best traditions of Greek and Roman democratic citizenship alive. The most serene republic---Serenissima, as Venice styled itself---had many democratic virtues: it was founded in equality and frank speech, at play in the liminal and willing to adapt collectively to defend itself and prosper. Venice owes its existence to its location on a large lagoon formed by the estuaries of many rivers to the west and by the long, thin sand islands thrown up by the currents of the Adriatic Sea to the east. Because of its location, Venice could avoid the worst of the barbarian invasions and the wars between empires to keep alive its own republican, and even democratic traditions.",

abstract = {ABSTRACT Gerontocracy, in its narrowest sense, refers to political systems ruled by elderly people, whether de jure or de facto. Although formal gerontocratic rules are progressively disappearing, contemporary political systems are still governed by individuals who are significantly older than the mean voter. This article reviews existing explanations for the prevalence of gerontocracy. To summarize main findings, gerontocracy cannot be explained by the leadership qualities of older rulers: aging leaders do not perform better in office and voters seem to be aware of it. Instead, existing research suggests that gerontocracy can be explained by strategic considerations. In autocracies, the selectorate tends to choose aging leaders in order to reduce their expected tenure length. In democracies, voters are more likely to select experienced candidates, which they expect to be more effective at advancing the interests of their constituency: this premium put on experience mechanically lengthens political careers and increases the age of the average politician. Finally, older voters, which participate more in politics, tend to prefer older politicians, because they (correctly) expect them to better defend their own interests.},
